Score   Name & Lab
================================================
254.00  Hanspeter Pfister, Beerflakes
207.00  Aaron Hertzmann, RSI Research Institute
206.00  Matt Pharr, Encore No. 1
204.00  Tim Purcell
191.00  David Salesin, Graphics Small Caps
177.00  Gary Yngve, Phunkadelic
176.00  Peter Shirley, Shirley by Pharr

125.00  Anton Kirczenow, Cornelius Graphics Inc.

<P>
These results are derived from the <a href="http://helios.siggraph.org/s2001/conference/papers/index.html">SIGGRAPH papers</a> and <a href="http://helios.siggraph.org/s2001/conference/skapps/index.html">sketches</a>.
Here are summaries of SIGGRAPH 2001 <a href="sigpaper.txt">paper</a> and <a href="sigsketch.txt">sketch</a> titles and authors (well, first authors for sketches (well, "presenters" for sketches, they're not papers)).

<P>
<B>Tempest in a Teapot:</B> There was an error in the database of contestants. It turns out Harry Shum and Heung-Yeung Shum are the same person. Harry is listed as costing 15 Quatloos, Heung-Yeung as 60. Harry/Heung-Yeung was worth 48.57 points this year. David Salesin and David Bourguignon hired Harry Shum for 15 Quatloos. So what's fair? We could
<UL>
<LI> Go for the bureaucratic nightmare: Award no additional points; Harry Shum was hired, Heung-Yeung Shum was awarded the points. No additional points awarded.
<LI> Go for fair wages: Harry was paid 15 Quatloos instead of his true worth of 75 Quatloos. As such, the lab hires him for only one day a week (make it Thursday), and gets the benefit of only 15/75ths (1/5th) of his point value, i.e. 48.57/5 = 9.714 additional points.
<LI> Go for an inflationary scenario: David Salesin paid 400 Quatloos for his team, and if he had hired Harry at full cost he would have paid 460. So give him full credit for Harry, 48.57 points, but multiply his final score by 400/460. This would have the effect of making David Salesin's score go by 17.32174. David Bourguignon's goes up by 28.53913.
<LI> Go libertarian: "buy low and sell high". The Davids found a market inefficiency and are simply exploiting it (or the bourgeois are exploiting a proletarian, depending on your spin). Award full points, 48.57.
</UL>
<P>
If this contest actually mattered in some way then we'd probably go with the "fair wages" method. However,
in the interests of causing chaos and controversy, while accentuating the judges' location on the evolutionary ladder as invertebrates... What I meant to say is that, in this post-modern world, who can really say who the winner is? And Everett's <a href="http://www.innerx.net/personal/tsmith/ManyWorlds.html">many worlds</a> interpretation of quantum mechanics allows for multiple winners - yeah, that's the ticket.
So, the solution is to award the Davids four score additions: +0, +5.714, +17.32174/+28.53913, and +48.57, each with an equal probability. Therefore the new rankings are, for the highest eleven of the top ten labs:
<PRE>
Score   Name & Lab
================================================
254.00  Hanspeter Pfister, Beerflakes
239.57  David "Rockefeller" Salesin, Graphics Small Caps
208.32  David "Inflation" Salesin, Graphics Small Caps
207.00  Aaron Hertzmann, RSI Research Institute
206.00  Matt Pharr, Encore No. 1
204.00  Tim Purcell
196.71  David "Iron Law of Wages" Salesin, Graphics Small Caps
191.00  David "Kafka" Salesin, Graphics Small Caps
177.00  Gary Yngve, Phunkadelic
176.00  Peter Shirley, Shirley by Pharr
153.57  David "Rockefeller" Bourguignon, Tasty Frogs R&D
150.00  Hector Yee, Generic Lab
144.00  Justin Legakis 
133.53  David "Inflation" Bourguignon, Tasty Frogs R&D
125.00  Anton Kirczenow, Cornelius Graphics Inc.
</PRE>
So David Salesin is in 2nd/2nd/5th/5th, i.e. (2+2+5+5)/4 = 3.5th place. Aaron Hertzmann is in 3rd/3rd/2nd/2nd place, i.e. 2.5th place, Matt is in 3.5th place, and Tim is in 4.5th place. Gary and Peter are in places where the quantum function collapsed, they're at 6th and 7th. Simple, neh? David Bourguignon then confuses things for the next 11 places (there's a three-way tie at 105 points) and I think he has 11.75th place overall.
Which of course makes no sense: we then have a first place winner, Aaron at 2.5th place, Matt and David Salesin tied at 3.5th, but such is the wacky world of quantum computer, FGL-style.

Hanspeter Pfister picked a pack of perfect people (I just had to say that):

We caught up with the now-famous Pfister in his newly-acquired mountaintop underwater lair. He took a few
minutes off from finishing work on his mind control laser array to answer a few questions.
<P>
<font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#0D3256">
<B>Q:</B> <I>First, to what do you owe your incredible success? Is it from powers beyond
the ken of mortal man, a pact with the devil, or exposure to beryllium rays
when you were a youngster that also let you grow your hair curlier than usual?
</I>

<P>
<B>A:</B> My hair is straight, so I guess it must be all the beer I drank that
gave me super powers. Note to my fans: Drink lots of &lt;shameless plug for
a brand of import beer deleted&gt;.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> <I>Is "Pfister" physically possible to pronounce?
</I>

<P>
Only after a good night of drinking. Or if you sneeze.
 
<P>
<B>Q:</B> <I>How are you enjoying your prizes, the platinum statue and the red Ferrari?
The man said he would deliver them by the end of last month, so you have
had enough time to get used to them.
</I>

<P>
I had to temporarily store them in my airplane hangar. My driver
couldn't fit the Ferrari in our garage and the statue didn't look good
next to all my antiques. Next month I will sell the Aston Martin to make
room for the Ferrari, and once we ship the David back to Italy we'll
display the... hem... platinum teapot. Thanks.

<P>
<B>Q:</B> <I>You picked yourself to be on your own team. Interestingly enough, 5 other
players picked you to be on their teams, including Matt Pharr (and myself,
Eric Haines). Will you now ask your boss for a raise?
</I>

<P>
My boss said that a raise is out of the question, but I don't have to
serve him coffee anymore. One step at a time...
 
<P>
<B>Q:</B> <I>How many six-cent stamps make a dozen?
</I>

<P>
What is a "cent"? 

<P>
<B>Q:</B> <I>Any last comments for your adoring fans and demoralized foes?
</I>

"I'll be back!"

72 research labs were formed this year (i.e. there were 72 contestants, to put it more vulgarly). Average team value was 74.490079365079 points, with 66.712301587301 points from papers and 7.777777777778 for sketches. The most popular researchers picked for labs were:

Everyone else's value is 40 points or less. Sarah Frisken's two sketches increased her value by 40 points, which helped give Hanspeter the burst of energy he needed to birdie a touchdown on the final lap, or something.

</PRE>
Aaron Hertzmann and David Salesin both scored with W. Freeman.
Hanspeter Pfister was the only one to select Sarah Frisken for his lab.Everyone else's efficiency is 3.0 or less. It is interesting how the highest cost was only 30 quatloos. If these 12 were made a lab, they would cost only 155 Quatloos but be worth 405 points. Beats me what the optimal team is this year. If you feel like figuring it out, here's the <a href="auth_eff.txt">full list</a>, and here's
the <a href="auth_alpha.txt">alphabetical list</a> of all researchers in the money (if not in the points).
