Fantasy Graphics League</h1>
<P>
The initial results are in from the judges, and, Oh. My. Golly. It's <a href="siggraph2000/index.htm">Matt Pharr</a> again; incredible:
<PRE>
Score   Name & Lab
================================================
206.00  Matt Pharr, Encore No. 1
204.00  Tim Purcell
194.00  Hanspeter Pfister, Beerflakes
191.00  David Salesin, Graphics Small Caps
187.00  Aaron Hertzmann, RSI Research Institute
176.00  Peter Shirley, Shirley by Pharr
150.00  Hector Yee, Generic Lab
137.00  Gary Yngve, Phunkadelic
125.00  Anton Kirczenow, Cornelius Graphics Inc.
124.00  Justin Legakis
</PRE>
These results are derived from the <a href="http://helios.siggraph.org/s2001/conference/papers/index.html">SIGGRAPH papers</a> (and here's a handy <a href="sigpaper.txt">summary of titles and authors</a>). The <a href="http://helios.siggraph.org/s2001/conference/skapps/index.html">SIGGRAPH sketches</a> are worth 20 points for the first author of the sketch, so the contest is not over yet. Sketches will be posted May 21st, so we will not know until then.
<P>
<B>Late-breaking controversy:</B> There was an error in the database of contestants. It turns out Harry Shum and Heung-Yeung Shum are the same person. Harry is listed as costing 15 Quatloos, Heung-Yeung as 60. Harry/Heung-Yeung was worth 28.57 points this year. David Salesin and David Bourguigon hired Harry Shum for 15 Quatloos. So what's fair? We could
<UL>
<LI> Go for an inflationary scenario: David Salesin paid 400 Quatloos for his team, and if he had hired Harry at full cost he would have paid 460. So give him full credit for Harry, 28.57 points, but multiply his final score by 400/460. This would have the effect of making David's score go to 190.93, lower than his original score of 191, thus proving that inflation hurts everyone. Too much calculator work, anyway.
<LI> Go for the bureaucratic nightmare: Award no additional points; Harry Shum was hired, Heung-Yeung Shum was awarded the points. No additional points awarded.
<LI> Go for fair wages: Harry was paid 15 Quatloos instead of his true worth of 75 Quatloos. As such, the lab hires him for only one day a week (make it Thursday), and gets the benefit of only 15/75ths (1/5th) of his point value, i.e. 28.57/5 = 5.714 additional points.
<LI> Go libertarian: "buy low and sell high". The Davids found a market inefficiency and are simply exploiting it (or the bourgeois are exploiting a proletarian, depending on your spin). Award full points, 28.57.
</UL>
<P>
If this contest actually mattered in some way then we'd probably go with the "fair wages" method. However,
in the interests of causing chaos and controversy, while accentuating the judges' location on the evolutionary ladder as invertebrates... What I meant to say is that, in this post-modern world, who can really say who the winner is? And Everett's <a href="http://www.innerx.net/personal/tsmith/ManyWorlds.html">many worlds</a> interpretation of quantum mechanics allows for multiple winners - yeah, that's the ticket.
So, the solution is to award the Davids three score additions: +0, +5.714, and +28.57, each with an equal probability. Therefore, effective immediately, the new rankings are:
<PRE>
Score   Name & Lab
================================================
219.57  David "Rockefeller" Salesin, Graphics Small Caps
206.00  Matt Pharr, Encore No. 1
204.00  Tim Purcell
196.71  David "Iron Law of Wages" Salesin, Graphics Small Caps
194.00  Hanspeter Pfister, Beerflakes
191.00  David "Kafka" Salesin, Graphics Small Caps
187.00  Aaron Hertzmann, RSI Research Institute
176.00  Peter Shirley, Shirley by Pharr
150.00  Hector Yee, Generic Lab
137.00  Gary Yngve, Phunkadelic
125.00  Anton Kirczenow, Cornelius Graphics Inc.
124.00  Justin Legakis
</PRE>
So at this point David Salesin is in 1st/3rd/4th, i.e. (1+3+4)/3 = 2.333rd place. Matt Pharr is in 1st/1st/2nd, i.e. 1.333rd place, Tim is in 2.333rd place also, and Hanspeter is in 3.667th place. Simple, neh?
<P>
72 research labs were formed this year (i.e. there were 72 contestants, to put it more vulgarly). Average team value, so far, is 66.7123015873016 points. The most popular researchers picked for labs were:

All for now; this should give you something to chew on while waiting for the sketches results. Will Matt do an <I>n</I>-peat, where <I>n</I>=2? Or will Tim, Hanspeter, David, Aaron, or someone else blast past him in a burst of additive speed? Stay tuned to find out...
