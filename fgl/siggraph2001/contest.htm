Fantasy Graphics League</h1>
<B>
Entering a team for the Fantasy Graphics League is closed for this year, all teams had to be in by January 10, 2001. The forms still work, except for the final form which submits your entry. The rest of this page is left as-is, for your
bemusement.
</B>

<P>
The 2000-2001 draft season for the FGL is now open <B>[no it's not]</B>. Within your limited
budget and restricted floorspace, you are trying to hire the best virtual
graphics research lab possible. You can spend up to 400 Quatloos and have
room to hire 12 people for the next year for your lab. You can hire from
a list of 517 people. These people are researchers who have been authors
of one or more <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/">SIGGRAPH</a> papers in
the past five years, 1996-2000. Each person is given a cost in Quatloos,
based on their past performance. The deadline for hiring your lab is midnight
of January 10, 2001, same as the <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2001/">SIGGRAPH
2001</a> papers deadline. You can enter more than once, and only your last
entry will be used.
<p>Your performance is judged by how your people do at SIGGRAPH 2001. If
one of your researchers is an author on a SIGGRAPH 2001 technical paper,
you receive 60<i>/(# of authors)</i> points. If one of your researchers
is the first author on a technical sketch (not a paper), you receive 20
points. Sum up the points and that's your performance rating. Come in first
in the field of contenders and you may win a 1.9 GHz laptop with a GeForce5
or win a Playstation 9. Key word: "may".
<p>For more information and all the good jokes, see <a href="siggraph2000/contest.htm">last
year's contest page</a> and <a href="siggraph2000/index.htm">last year's
results</a>.
