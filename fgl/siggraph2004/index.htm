Here is his winning team:
<P>
<PRE>
 1  cost: 15  value: 80.00  John Hart
 2  cost: 40  value: 50.00  Alla Sheffer
 3  cost: 25  value: 12.00  Ian Buck

</PRE>
<P>
Amazingly enough, John Hart was also the grossest and cheapest, I mean, the largest grossing and most cost-effective researcher you could hire this year. Easily his best investment was to hire himself.
<P>
He was able to pull ahead of last year's winner Antoine McNamara in the end because one of his lab members, Alla Sheffer, scored 20 points for a sketch. Your reward for reading this far: <a href="sigsketch.txt">a list of this year's sketches and first authors</a>, information currently not available anywhere else (well, <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2004/conference/sketches/index.php?pageID=conference">here</a>, eventually).
<P>
The final top ten labs were:

</PRE>
<P>
This year five of the top ten were helped by sketches. Compare this to <a href="../siggraph2003/index.htm">last year's results</a>, where sketches had absolutely no
effect on the standings. Me, I'm just happy I actually finished in the top ten - woo hoo, it's my birthday, it's my birthday. The bribes I paid myself were well worth it.
<P>
Without further ado, here's the post-game interview with this year's winner.
<P>
<font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#000000">
<I>John Hart:</I> Before we begin, please let me offer my humblest congratulations to
Antoine McNamara for his outstanding performance with the FGL by saying
"lah-hoo-zah-her."
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#4A3C92">
<I>Humble Scribe:</I> This was a close race. Do you think you won because the American people 
were concerned about the issues, or because of your natural charisma and common touch?
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#000000">
<I>JH:</I> Like all politicians, I won because I cheated. My fantasy lab consisted
of people whose papers I could not review because of a conflict of
interest, so I volunteered for every SIGGRAPH paper I was eligible to
review, and soundly rejected all of them.
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#4A3C92">
<I>HS:</I> How will you spend all that money?
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#000000">
<I>JH:</I> I'm going to follow the lead of Marc Olano and order 200 lbs of silly
putty directly from DuPont, which is enough to build an entire human
being.
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#4A3C92">
Some parts of the US question whether genetic algorithms should be
taught in school, preferring to teach only of the existence of
oracle-based intelligent design methodologies. How does this affect your
teaching?
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#000000">
The rods and cones in a monkey retina are arranged in a Poisson-disk
pattern so the monkey isn't distracted by aliasing when watching out for
lurking tigers. Obviously the monkey should have been watching out for
<I>scientists</I>.
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#4A3C92">
When you teach, are you a more Gangsta-style rapper, or 
have you gone more Rapcore or perhaps Crunk?
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#000000">
I often get the comment on teacher feedback forms: "Look forward to the
times when Prof. Hart is traveling and his grad student teaches the
class."
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#4A3C92">
Why did you represent New Jersey and not Illinois or 
Washington State when you signed the Declaration of Independence?
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#000000">
Ah. You got this from the part of <a href="http://graphics.cs.uiuc.edu/~jch/">my webpage</a> that points to other John
Harts. This is because Google uses a "hubs and authorities" metric when
sorting its index. I like to think that when you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=john+hart">Google John Hart</a> you
get my webpage because I'm important, but it's really because my webpage
is an authority on the John-Hartness of things.
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#4A3C92">
How would you avoid wardrobe malfunctions in the future?
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#000000">
Avoid them?! I'm very much in favor of them.
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#4A3C92">
You hired yourself for your own team. If you start to underperform 
because you hate your boss, will you fire yourself, or just 
give yourself a stern talking-to?
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#000000">
If I were my own boss, I'd offer myself professional advancement in
exchange for sexual favors.
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#4A3C92">
In the third quarter, what was it that made you decide to go for it 
instead of taking the easy field goal?
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#000000">
I was losing to Antoine McNamara before the sketches results came out
and saved my butt. I'll have to take that into consideration the next
time I argue against the existence and utility of the sketches program.
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#4A3C92">
Is this just a game, or do friendships affect your 
alliances and who you vote off the island?
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#000000">
It's all a game. SIGGRAPH papers. Tenure. Monkeyball.
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#4A3C92">
Coming into the home stretch, the last innning, the sixth chukker, 
Antoine McNamara looked like he was going to have a two-peat, grab the 
brass ring, take the crown, win the Beehive Boot trophy, and go for the 
gold. To what do you owe your come from behind, dark horse, underdog, never 
say die, never say lose, never say 
<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/p/pneumono.html">pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis</a> victory?
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#000000">
As David Cross said at the end of his Celebrity Poker run, "I wanted to
give 110%, but felt in the end I was only able to give about 108%."
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#4A3C92">
The yacht you sent me really was not necessary. One quick 
question: what is the best way to polish the gold-plated fixtures?
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#000000">
It's amazing what you can buy with "startup" money.
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#4A3C92">
Why do you think voters selected you this year as the best 
supporting actor in a new sitcom?
<P>
</font><font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#000000">
Huh? I think perhaps you might have me confused with Dick Cheney.
</font>

<P>
Well, that's that, then. And <a href="http://www.barbneal.com/wav/ltunes/misc/thatsall.wav">adebadadebadadebada that's all folks</a>: this will be the last year for the Fantasy Graphics League. It's been fun, but it's also become more and more difficult to run, as servers clamp down on "sendmail" to avoid spam, making it hard to send out results, etc. Of course, come November I might get bored and run it just one last time, again...

<P>
Speaking of email, I do hope to send results to all participants sometime soon.
If you're dying to know right now who was worth how many points this year, check the <a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/fgl/siggraph2004/auth_alpha.txt">author list</a>.
