<h1> Fantasy Graphics League First Round Results for 2004</h1>

<P>

The Top Ten Lab Directors currently are: 

<PRE>

Points  Name &amp; Lab

=========================================================

282.50  Antoine McNamara, lab name: The Inverse Kinematics

272.00  John Hart, lab name: The GPU Abuse Center

255.00  Mira Dontcheva 

240.00  T. Aila, J. Lehtinen, V. Miettinen, lab name: rand()%680 + 1


232.50  Aaron Hertzmann, lab name: Funky Homunculi

212.00  Jan Kautz, lab name: Pixel-Mob

180.00  Frank Losasso, lab name: The space partitioners

177.50  Eric Haines, lab name: A Growing Concern

169.50  Jonathan Cohen, lab name: Sigraphopoly

169.00  Alan Chalmers, lab name: only_once_a_year

</PRE>

<p>out of 57 contestants. Yes, the <a href="../siggraph2003/index.htm">previous year's winner, Antoine McNamara</a>, is indeed in first place at this point. Could this be the year we have a two-peat? It almost happened in the <a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/fgl/siggraph2001/index.htm">second FGL</a>, where Matt Pharr was leading the pack, only to be overcome in the end by Hanspeter Pfister's sketch winners. It's noteworthy that Antoine McNamara and John Hart each hired themselves for their own labs. Oh, and woohoo, I'm in 8th place - this is the first time I've actually come in anywhere over the median, let alone in the top ten.

<P>

Here are which researchers were chosen by the most lab directors:

<PRE>

Authors, by popularity on teams

===============================

14 Peter-Pike Sloan

12 Fr&eacute;do Durand

11 Kavita Bala

10 Ren Ng

 9 Ian Buck

 9 Aaron Hertzmann

 8 John Hart

 8 Wojciech Matusik

 8 Jovan Popovic

 7 Michael F. Cohen

 7 Jan Kautz

 7 Aseem Agarwala

</PRE>

Most of these researchers, 9 of 12, were in the money. However, only two of them were among the most efficient, i.e. gave the most bang for the buck, or most quarks for the quatloo:

<P>

As far as sheer points earned goes, here's the researcher list (recall that this does not include authors new this year, but rather only those authors who could be chosen):

Authors ranked by highest point value





###  Value Cost Efficiency Name

=============================================

294  80.00   15   5.3333   John Hart

209  65.00  170   0.3824   Heung-Yeung Shum

588  60.00   15   4.0000   Tao Ju

313  60.00   30   2.0000   Jovan Popovic

136  60.00   90   0.6667   Dinesh K. Pai

141  60.00  100   0.6000   Doug L. James

521  60.00  150   0.4000   Ronald Fedkiw

198  59.00  140   0.4214   Hans-Peter Seidel

267  55.00  100   0.5500   Jessica K. Hodgins

223  55.00  210   0.2619   Hugues Hoppe

</PRE>

Kudos to John Hart, who managed to be both the largest grossing and most cost-effective researcher this year, along with currently being in second place in the FGL. Honorable mention goes to Tao Ju, who is third in both categories.

<P>

Interesting side note: if you picked the previous four years' winners of the FGL for your lab (all of whom could be hired as researchers), their stats are:

<PRE>

###  Value Cost Efficiency Name

=============================================

403   0.00   30   0.0000   Matt Pharr

199  30.00   70   0.4286   Hanspeter Pfister

  4  30.00   70   0.4286   Aaron Hertzmann

 47  15.00   15   1.0000   Antoine McNamara

</PRE>

So you would have received 75 points for 185 quatloos (with 215 left to spend). This would have started you off in 35th place among the 57 teams. And if you had noticed that Matt Pharr was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/012553180X?tag=somebooksilike">writing a book</a>, you would have ruled him out and had even more to spend. Of course, I didn't use this strategy either, but I lucked out picking John Hart.

<P>

This year is (probably - no promises) going to be the last time I run the FGL, since after about the fifth repetition of a joke it just might start to lose its edge. In the hopes of generating controversy and scandal, I'm on the SIGGRAPH Sketches committee this year. To head off any charges of favoritism, please let me know now which researchers you've hired are likely to affect your score: simply write their names on a $20 bill and send it to me.

<P>

If you want to check your results or have some peculiar desire to actually see what papers were accepted, see <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~tor/sig2004.html">Tim Rowley's great web page</a>. I've also put up the <a href="auth_alpha.txt">alphabetical listing of hireable researchers</a> and how many points each earned this year.
