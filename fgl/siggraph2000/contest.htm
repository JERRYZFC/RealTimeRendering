<h1>

The Fantasy Graphics League</h1>



<B>

Entering a team for the Fantasy Graphics League is closed for this year,

all teams had to be in by January 12, 2000, 5 pm Pacific Time. The forms

still work, except for the final form which submits your entry.

</B>



<P>

If baseball, football, basketball, and even the Tour de France can do it,

so can computer graphics. While you're staying up late trying to make your

SIGGRAPH submission's LaTeX compile, for the love of Adam, compile, you hellspawn document, we

provide here a simple diversion. If you tire of the day to day sports news,

you can instead attempt to track the movements and doings of past SIGGRAPH

authors (stalking is prohibited). Fame, fortune, and neither of these

await you!

<p>The concept is simple. You have 400 <a href="http://www.quatloos.com/">Quatloos</a>.

Instead of <a href="http://www2.liglobal.com/simpsons/movies/quatloos.qt" TARGET="_new">wagering

it on the newcomer</a>, you are to hire up to twelve computer graphics

researchers to produce papers for SIGGRAPH 00 (000?). You have around 473

(well, exactly 473) previous SIGGRAPH authors to choose from; in fact,

all SIGGRAPH technical paper authors from 1995 through 1999. Each author

has a cost rating, based on a simple, idiotic formula. To wit, each paper an author

was involved in during this time period increases his or her cost rating by:

<blockquote>60 / (number of authors who wrote the paper)</blockquote>

60 is chosen for its connection to <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Babylonian_and_Egyptian.html">Babylonian

mathematics</a>, a field which has no connection with SIGGRAPH but may someday

be visualized with computer graphics in a way that maximizes funding for

the researchers doing the work.

<p>An author's rating is the sum of his or her contributions. This formula was

chosen because it's simple to code and to understand, and because it cannot

be considered a fair rating of anyone's real worth. This is a game, not

a tenure track rating system. Hey, if it's any solace, my rating's zero;

I struggle on, a hollow shell of a human being, but somehow still survive.

<p>The object: score the most points, based on both papers and sketches

accepted for SIGGRAPH 00. The scoring system is:

<blockquote>60 / (number of paper authors)

<br>20 / (number of sketch authors)</blockquote>

added together for each paper or sketch that your chosen author is involved

in. For example, you hire J. Worthington Kudzu for your team. He is one

of four authors on the groundbreaking paper, "On Cross-Vertex Meta-Wavelet

Hierarchy Determination", so would score 60/4=15 points for it. He also

had a technical sketch called "Modeling Desperation and Angst"; as the

single author, he scores 20/1=20 points for this contribution. His total

score for your team is 35 points. Whichever submitted team has the most

points, wins. The tie-breaker is who spent the least in Quatloos for their

team; the second tie-breaker is the smaller number of researchers on a

team; after that, we flip coins or toss pigs or somesuch. What do you win?

Beats us. But we'll come up with something.

<p>The deadline is <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2000/cfp/papers/index.html">12

January 2000, 5 pm Pacific Time</a>, just like <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2000/">SIGGRAPH

2000</a>. To research members for your lab, you might check

<A HREF="http://www.cgrg.ohio-state.edu/~spencer/gbib.html">SIGGRAPH's Bibliography

Database Search</a>. Here you can search on authors, and at the middle of this page

there are links to lists of what papers were published in SIGGRAPH and elsewhere. Or

you can forget research and just pick a team made of people named "John".

<p>Some may complain that other conferences are ignored, journals are ignored,

impact papers are not given more points, short papers are weighted the

same as long ones, and that the number of footnotes or corporate sponsors

are not factored in. Others may complain that new people, i.e. rookies,

are not included (if you deeply care, you get to write the Perl CGI script

next year for this thing...). Still others may worry about the effect on

the SIGGRAPH review process ("Your paper is accepted, on the condition

that the second author is removed and replaced by the following three people").

Some people are deeply concerned about improperly removing mattress tags

and keeping their scissors oiled, too. On the real concerns front: no,

we won't release any information about you to anyone or spam you. If you

are a winner, we will certainly want to say who you are - in such an event,

we will list the winning team submitted, and ask you for permission to

publicize your name and email address, at your discretion. We will also

probably do some statistical summation about the submitted teams as a whole.

<p>Disclaimers: we're doing this just for fun, as a game to lighten up

for submitters the last few hectic or boring hours before the SIGGRAPH deadline, and to

have everyone else get involved in thinking about the next SIGGRAPH. We have no affiliation

to (besides being enthusiastic members of) SIGGRAPH. We do not plan to

make any money from this; if anything, just the opposite.
