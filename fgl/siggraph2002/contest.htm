Fantasy Graphics League</h1>
<P>
<B>Entry to this year's Fantasy Graphics League is closed - come back in the fall to try for next year.</B>
<P>
While working away at your humdrum job of <a href="http://www.ucomics.com/bizarro/viewbz.cfm?uc_full_date=20010525&uc_comic=bz&uc_daction=X">astronaut, fireman, or pirate</a>,
you've often dreamed of being able to run a darkened laboratory full of
computers, Jolt, cool screensavers, and graphics gurus. Now's your chance to live the dream, or
at least dream the life, or something.
<P>
The 2001-2002 draft season for the Fantasy Graphics League (FGL) is now open. The facts:
<UL>
<LI> You have a budget of 400 Quatloos (which are worth more than Dreekars, but less than Tortlers).
<LI> You have room in your lab for up to 12 researchers.
<LI> You can hire from 568 people, all the researchers who have been part of a paper published during
the last 5 years at <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/">SIGGRAPH</a>.
<LI> You have until midnight PST on January 9, 2002, to create and submit your lab. <B>(Too late now!)</B>
</UL>
<p><font size=+4><a href="entry.htm">HIRE YOUR LAB</a></font>.
<B>(Well, actually, don't hire your lab, as entry for this year is closed. The form's been left up to look at and think what glory might have been yours.)</B>

<P>
"But wait," you say, "I need more information. How am I judged, how much do researchers cost, and <a href="http://www.acm.org/pubs/tog/editors/erich/ptinpoly/">how do I tell whether a point is in a polygon?</a>" That last question is <a href="http://www1.acm.org/pubs/tog/resources/RTNews/html/rtnv5n3.html#art1">difficult, if not undecidable</a>. As far as being judged, that's between you and your maker or parole officer (you want <I>good</I> jokes? wrong place...). Researchers cost:
<P>
<I>f(R)</I> = int( 0.5 + sum of ( 60 / (<I>Ci</I>+1) ) / 5) * 5, where <I>i</I>=1 to <I>n</I>
<P>
where <I>R</I> is the researcher, <I>Ci</I> is the number of coauthors a researcher also had on paper <I>i</I>, and <I>n</I> is the number of papers published in SIGGRAPH by the author from 1997 to 2001, inclusive. In Esperanto, this means an author is worth 60 Quatloos for publishing a single paper as a single author, 15 Quatloos if the author was one of 4 coauthors on a paper. Sum up the author's accomplishments, and you get a single number. Imagine, 5 years of sweat and toil reduced to a single number, and rounded at that. Not really fair, is it? If you're one of these authors and feel demeaned by having a single number sum up your worth, then please feel free to add a factorial sign to it and make a second, bigger number - now you have two numbers.
<P>
Scoring: each author is awarded points depending on whether they have a paper or technical sketch accepted at SIGGRAPH. Papers are worth 60 points divided by the number of coauthors, and sketches are worth 20 points for the first person listed for the sketch. Whatever lab has the most points (Why "points", anyway? Are they sharp and pointy? Infinitesimally small? What's the point?) is the winner of this year's contest. The crown, the goodwill world tour after the gala celebration at the finest hotel, the honorary degrees, the pictures on the covers of newsweeklies, the fan letters and children named after you, none of this will be yours for winning this contest. But it's free to enter, and you were unlikely to get any of those other things this year, anyway. Enter <B>(well, actually, don't enter,
as entry is now closed)</B> by clicking <a href="entry.htm">here</a>, <a href="entry.htm">there</a>, or on the period at the end of this sentence<a href="entry.htm">.</a>
<P>
So get out there and figure out who is having brilliant breakthroughs in graphics. Study the past publications, visit web sites, go to conferences, and sit in on thesis defenses. Or do as I'm doing, and just pick a bunch of <a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/people.html">Stanford CGL grad students</a> and call it a day.
<P>
Oh, and check out the <a href="../siggraph2001/index.htm">results of last year's contest</a>.
