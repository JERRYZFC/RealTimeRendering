<p>out of 78 contestants. Surprisingly, the sketches <a href="prelim.htm">had 
  no effect whatsoever</a> on the team rankings this year (more about the individual 
  author rankings will follow). Aaron Hertzmann was the only person to score off 
  of sketches, gaining 20 points for Michael Kazhdan. The winning research lab, 
  Super Butter Dog, was:

<p>We caught up with Aaron somewhere within 13,000 miles of the Marianas Trench, 
  where he gave this brief interview. <font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#0D3256"> 
  </font></p>
<font face="LUCIDA, ARIAL, HELVETICA" color="#0D3256"><P>
<B>Q:</B> <I>Congratulations on your victory! How you do plan to celebrate?
</I>

<P>
<B>A:</B> By moving somewhere REALLY REALLY cold!

<P>
<B>Q:</B> <I>In last year's FGL contest you finished second, edging out the previous
previous year's first place winner, Matt Pharr. Now you're the top dog, the
big cheese, the bigtop cheese-dog. To what do you owe your success?
</I>

<P>
<B>A:</B> Hard work, teamwork, fair play, cooperation, everyone came to the field to
play and gave 110%.  In the words of a famous baseball coach: "The team did
all the work; I didn't play a single inning."

<P>
Actually, last year I realized that the Fantasy Graphics League is far
sweeter a cherry
than having an actual SIGGRAPH papers, and focused my efforts on scouting
for my team (so-called "job interviews").  In the words of a famous soccer
coach: "Mais um caipirinha, por favor."


<P>
<B>Q:</B> <I>Will you use your new-found powers for good or evil?
</I>

<P>
<B>A:</B> Powers?  What powers?

<P>
I was hoping for Austin Powers, but I all got were these Francis Gary Powers.
Bleah.  What good is that?



<P>
<B>Q:</B> <I>Please tell us how this victory has changed your life. Is your life now
really like a Coke commercial with singing? Or has your existence simply
had subtitles added to it, so that people around the world may understand
and gain strength from it?
</I>

<P>
<B>A:</B> I like to think that we are all winners, each in our own special way.
But it's nice to know that, in a more accurate sense, I'm the winner.  In a
49-point spread sense.  Ahhh.


<P>
<B>Q:</B><I> Do you have any other answers you'd like us to give you questions for?
</I>

<P>
Yes, <B>Q:</B> Just how funky is Super Butter Dog?

<P>
<B>A:</B> I would say <a href="http://www.five-d.co.jp/sbd/">moderately so.</a>


<P>
<B>Q:</B><I> Say "silk" five times fast. Now, what do cows drink?
</I>

<P>
<B>A:</B> How should I know?  Ask a biologist.  Tang, perhaps?


<P>
<B>Q:</B><I> Do you have any words of discouragement for next year's contestants?
</I>

<P>
<B>A:</B> Follow your dreams, climb every mountain, smell every rose, swim every
fjord, scale every
wall, bake every cake, hug every monkey, light every fire, mull every cider,
etc.

<p>What is a sport without gratuitous statistics about the players?
So, here's a little more analysis of how the rank of the authors themselves
was affected by the sketch results.
The new efficiency ranking for the authors is:
<PRE>
Authors ranked by efficiency
### Value Cost Efficiency Name
=============================================
220 20.00    5   4.0000   James Davis
142 65.00   20   3.2500   Fabio Pellacini
334 60.00   20   3.0000   Marc Alexa
297 60.00   20   3.0000   Ken Perlin
 38 12.00    5   2.4000   Aseem Agarwala
 75 45.00   20   2.2500   Christoph Bregler
548 20.00   10   2.0000   Xianfeng Gu
 79 20.00   10   2.0000   Cindy M. Grimm
384 20.00   10   2.0000   Michael Kazhdan
 92 20.00   10   2.0000   Dani Lischinski
</PRE>
Note how sketches moved 5 different authors into the top 10 for efficiency (see 
the pre-sketch top 10 <a href="prelim.htm">beyond this blue ink</a>). Also note 
that, because sketch points do not count towards an author's cost (only authorship 
for the last five years of SIGGRAPH papers counts), these authors will not go 
up in cost next year. 
<P>
The rankings based entirely on points earned this year were not much affected
by the sketches. The only effect on the top ranked authors was that James F. O'Brien
joined the "60 point club" (there were a lot of these this year):
<PRE>

### Value Cost Efficiency Name
=============================================
142 65.00   20   3.2500   Fabio Pellacini
569 62.00   40   1.5500   Zoran Popovic
334 60.00   20   3.0000   Marc Alexa
449 60.00   50   1.2000   Ronald Fedkiw
195 60.00  100   0.6000   Heung-Yeung Shum
221 60.00  100   0.6000   James F. O'Brien
297 60.00   20   3.0000   Ken Perlin
162 60.00   65   0.9231   George Drettakis
190 50.00   85   0.5882   Henrik Wann Jensen
239 47.00   90   0.5222   Jessica K. Hodgins
 75 45.00   20   2.2500   Christoph Bregler
410 45.00  240   0.1875   Pat Hanrahan
 53 44.00   50   0.8800   Brian Curless
279 42.00   70   0.6000   Julie Dorsey
 40 40.00   70   0.5714   Baining Guo
123 35.00  150   0.2333   Donald P. Greenberg
</PRE>
So, one could conclude that most top point-earning authors do not submit sketches, if the
year number is 2002.
