<P>
So, the <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~tor/sig2002.html">SIGGRAPH 2002 papers</a> have been announced, and the world pauses in its circuit around the sun as the results are compiled...
<p>
The Top Eleven (which sounds more dramatic than "the people with 200 or more points") at this point are:
<PRE>
Points  Name &amp; Lab
=========================================================
306.67  Aaron Hertzmann, Super Butter Dog
277.57  Tim Purcell, Wunky Munky Du
265.00  Hugues Hoppe, Shlomo &amp; Hugues
255.24  Ian Buck, The Frys Addicts
243.57  Henrik Wann Jensen, The Vikings
230.00  Zeki Melek, incompressible fluid motion (?)
227.00  Mathieu Desbrun, The cheap ones (quatloos-wise)
218.57  Cyrille Damez
217.67  Brian Curless and David Salesin, Pixel Polytech
202.00  Dave Zareski, Particle Tracers
200.00  Peter Shirley, Utah Polygonists
</PRE>
out of 78 contestants. {My mindless "hire Stanford students" strategy worked fairly well, putting me in 14th place. Actually, this was a tough strategy to follow, since I couldn't afford everyone. I missed some real winners, such as Christoph "20 will get you 45" Bregler. With Stanford having some part in 10 more papers this year, there will be even more rookies to choose from next year, if anyone tries this strategy.}
<P>
<I>[Late breaking news: Pete Shirley noticed that he was worthless this year. This was an error on my part, a stray blank space at the end of a line in a data file caused his name and the paper he worked on to be ignored. The results above show him in his proper place. D'oh, and points for Zoran `last person on the list' Popovic didn't get added in; this fix kicked Aaron Hertzmann into first place! Oh, and another, the accent in Bruno L&eacute;vy's name made him at first have no points. Oh, and Dani Lischinski was misspelt, as was Norman Badler, so these have now scored. I'll wait a day before sending out an update. If you notice more errors, let me know.]</I>
<P>
Things are not over yet: the <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2002/conference/sketches/index.html">sketches</a> first authors are worth 20 points each, and will not be announced until June 7th. Recall that <a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/fgl/siggraph2001/index.htm">Hanspeter Pfister picked up 60 points last year</a> with the Frisken gambit off the back wall, getting a double quoit in the last chukar. Our current leader, Aaron Hertzmann, was in <a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/fgl/siggraph2001/prelim.htm">fifth place at this time last year</a>, but picked up 20 points and finished second once the wildcard sketches were tabulated.
<P>
Most impressive this year is that the high scores are considerably higher than <a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/fgl/siggraph2001/prelim.htm">last year</a>, a solid 100 points higher. It was interesting to see the effect of resubmits: up until the deadline you could submit a new, revised team - only the last team submitted counts as your entry. Tim Purcell's initial team would have put him in 6th place, but his revision netted him an extra 44 points. Others were not so lucky. Of the four other people who revised their team once, only one person moved up, by 28 points; the other three moved down, by 15, 24, and 60 points. Of the two people who revised their teams twice, each final team was lower than the initial team, down by 25 and 45 points. Conclude whatever you wish.

That is, these people gave the most points per Quatloo paid for them. Everyone else was rated 1.0 or less.

All for now, and keep a <a href="http://www.spyonit.com">Spyonit watcher</a> on the <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s2002/conference/sketches/index.html">SIGGRAPH sketches page</a> to see how your lab finally stacks up, or just visit here again come mid-June.
