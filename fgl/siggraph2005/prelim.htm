<h1>
Fantasy Graphics League 2005 Almost Results</h1>

Who are the top ten teams? Well, luckily more than ten people entered the contest, so that question is meaningful (but just barely: a mere 29 entries this year, not including the 1000 monkeys). Here are the pre-sketch (papers only) results:

<PRE>
233.43  name: Yaohua Hu, lab_name: MSRAIG
231.50  name: Jessica Hodgins, lab_name: hoping for the best
158.50  name: Aila, Lehtinen, Laine and Miettinen, lab_name: rand()%745 + 1
151.57  name: Tom Mertens, lab_name: Breakfast Clubbers
150.00  name: Doug Epps, lab_name: Everything.com
136.00  name: captain, lab_name: big researchers with dental failure
123.57  name: Zhaosheng Bao, lab_name: fracture
123.57  name: Stephen H. Westin, lab_name: Big Red
108.57  name: Pieter Peers, lab_name: Mom's Friendly Graphics Lab
105.00  name: Cyril Soler, lab_name: Hairy cheese'lab
</PRE>

Can 29 human teams hold off 1000 flying monkeys armed with quatloos and typewriters? Well, here are how 1000 random monkey teams made out:

<PRE>
213.14  name: Fundi Washoe Tomasello, lab_name: Monkey #509
185.00  name: Faustino Birute Sanz, lab_name: Monkey #333
169.24  name: Fifi Cheeta Premack, lab_name: Monkey #692
161.14  name: Flo Sherman Varki, lab_name: Monkey #970
151.14  name: Fred Austin Fossey, lab_name: Monkey #185
150.57  name: Ferdinand Dian Premack, lab_name: Monkey #624
146.14  name: Fred Crickette Rumbaugh, lab_name: Monkey #745
141.14  name: Fifi Austin Terrace, lab_name: Monkey #882
137.00  name: Fifi Crickette Tomasello, lab_name: Monkey #542
132.00  name: Fred Dian McGrew, lab_name: Monkey #425
</PRE>

Those damn dirty apes are only a little more than a sketch author away from victory. The monkeys picked teams by randomly choosing, throwing away any choices that put them over their quatloo limit. For whatever reason, Kelly Dobson (who didn't earn any points this year) was the most popular pick among the chimps, chosen 31 times. Among the humans, there was a three-way tie in popularity among Paul Debevec, Steve Marschner, and Bruce Walter, each selected by five labs, and all of whom scored points.

<P>
The best monkey team right now, led by chimp Fundi Washoe Tomasello ("Monkey #509" to his friends), is:

<PRE>
### Cost  Name
===============================
311   10  Joel Hindorff
320   10  John Eyles
321    5  John F. Hughes
119  100  Daniel Cohen-Or
233  210  Heung-Yeung Shum
 59   10  Avneesh Sud
423   20  Mark Kilgard
169   30  Eric Tabellion
453    5  Michael A. Kowalski
</PRE>

It's interesting this chimp picked John F. "Spike" Hughes, as Spike turns out to be the most cost effective choice this year:

<PRE>
### Value Cost Efficiency Name
==============================================
322 32.00    5   6.4000   John F. Hughes
269 25.00    5   5.0000   James Davis
353 20.00    5   4.0000   Kari Pulli
167 30.00   10   3.0000   Enrico Gobbetti
180 30.00   10   3.0000   Fabio Marton
275 30.00   10   3.0000   Jarek Rossignac
642 35.00   15   2.3333   Takeo Igarashi
461 60.00   30   2.0000   Michael F. Deering
380 30.57   20   1.5286   Kun Zhou
423 15.24   10   1.5238   Mark Horowitz
</PRE>

Choosing these ten as a lab would have cost a mere 120 quatloos and netted 307.81 points.
<P>
This same monkey also picked for his lab the largest point winner overall, Heung-Yeung Shum, who was worth 111.14 points this year:

<PRE>
### Value  Cost Efficiency Name
===============================================
234 111.14  210   0.5293   Heung-Yeung Shum
120  70.00  100   0.7000   Daniel Cohen-Or
181  70.00   85   0.8235   Fabio Pellacini
232  65.00  120   0.5417   Henrik Wann Jensen
 62  61.14   90   0.6794   Baining Guo
461  60.00   30   2.0000   Michael F. Deering
154  60.00  130   0.4615   Doug L. James
559  60.00   50   1.2000   Ren Ng
192  56.00  140   0.4000   Fr&eacute;do Durand
573  55.00  210   0.2619   Ronald Fedkiw
340  50.00   90   0.5556   Jovan Popovic
</PRE>

Past participants may recall Dr. Shum from the <a href="../siggraph2001/index.htm">2001 FGL</a>, where it was discovered that he could be bought cheap, as he was listed as both Heung-Yeung and Harry.
In a similar vein, there was one (known) goof in the contest this year: shockingly, Andrew Gardner and Andy Gardner are the same person. One human hired Andrewy for his team, and was charged the lower price, but that player is not in the top ten currently, so there's unlikely to be any controversy. Pity.

<P>

Interestingly, last year's most efficient and largest overall point-getter, Fabio Pellacini, is still high in the overall rankings this year. His efficiency rating is down this year, of course, since his value increased so much last year.

All for now, until the results of the sketches committee are public.
